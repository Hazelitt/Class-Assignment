My greatest fear.
 
My greatest fear is being torn apart by cosmic horros beyond imagination, those of higher intelligence and greater potential that pose a threat to me, causes my mental sanity to vanish when faced with such opposition. When only death is presented as the remaining option, fear becomes the most prominent emotion that the body responds with, this causes an Instinctual reaction of being prey in which only running is the correct response.
